# Greg Perlman's Exercism.io Solutions

## About

I will be documenting my progress through exercism.io's programming challenges.

My plan is to complete the Ruby section and follow-up with JavaScript. Other languages are TBD. Below, there is an updated progress on where I am at in the challenges.

Feel free to comment on or contribute to my solutions. If you'd like to get in touch or are interested in more of my work, please visit <a href='http://gregperlman.net'>my website</a>.
